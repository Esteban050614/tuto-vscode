"On the other hand, we denounce with just indignation and disgust
 men who are so seduced and demoralized by the allures of momentary 
 pleasure, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the nice
  and anguish that are destined to follow; and the same is the fault
  of those who fail in their duty due to weakness of will, which is 
  perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our 
  power of Choice is free and when nothing prevents us from doing 
  what we like best, all pleasures should be welcomed and all pains 
  avoided, but in certain circumstances and due to the demands of 
  duty or business obligations, it will often happen that pleasures 
  must be repudiated and discomforts accepted.The wise man
  therefore, always adheres to this principle of selection in these matters: he rejects pleasures in order to obtain other greater pleasures, or he endures pains to avoid worse pains".
